# Robot-Design

### Robot parts

***The robot consists of approximately 6 parts:***
*The head, neck, eye screen, tires, the frame, and the advertisement display screen.*

### Attention
*During the design, some important points were taken into account*
- Tires are placed in such a way as to ensure the balance of the robot and to ensure that it does not fall.
+ The frame is designed to hold the screen closed from the back to preserve the screen.
+ Front hatch for collision sensor.
+ We designed the screen with dimensions that clearly fit the display of the advertisement.
+ Also, the screen is tilted back slightly for eye relief.
